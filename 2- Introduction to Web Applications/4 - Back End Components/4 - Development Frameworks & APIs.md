# APIs

An important aspect of back end web application development is the use of Web [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) and HTTP Request parameters to connect the front end and the back end to be able to send data back and forth between front end and back end components and carry out various functions within the web application.

# Web APIs

An API ([Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)) is an interface within an application that specifies how the application can interact with other applications. For Web Applications, it is what allows remote access to functionality on back end components. APIs are not exclusive to web applications and are used for software applications in general. Web APIs are usually accessed over the `HTTP` protocol and are usually handled and translated through web servers.

# SOAP

The `SOAP` ([Simple Objects Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)) standard shares data through `XML`, where the request is made in `XML` through an HTTP request, and the response is also returned in `XML`. Front end components are designed to parse this `XML` output properly. The following is an example `SOAP` message:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<soap:Envelope
xmlns:soap="http://www.example.com/soap/soap/"
soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/soap/soap-encoding">

<soap:Header>
</soap:Header>

<soap:Body>
  <soap:Fault>
  </soap:Fault>
</soap:Body>

</soap:Envelope>
```

# REST

The `REST` ([Representational State Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) standard shares data through the URL path 'i.e. `search/users/1`', and usually returns the output in `JSON` format 'i.e. userid `1`'.

```bash
curl http://83.136.254.47:35777/index.php?id=1
```
