```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>A Heading</h1>
        <p>A Paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The `<head>` element usually contains elements that are not directly printed on the page, like the page title, while all main page elements are located under `<body>`. Other important elements include the `<style>`, which holds the page's CSS code, and the `<script>`, which holds the JS code of the page, as we will see in the next section.
