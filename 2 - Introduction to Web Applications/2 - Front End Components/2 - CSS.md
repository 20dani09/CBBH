```css
body {
  background-color: black;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: helvetica;
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

At a fundamental level, CSS is used to define the style of each class or type of HTML elements (i.e., `body` or `h1`), such that any element within that page would be represented as defined in the CSS file. This could include the font family, font size, background color, text color and alignment, and more.
