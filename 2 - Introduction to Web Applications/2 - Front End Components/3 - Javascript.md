[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is one of the most used languages in the world. It is mostly used for web development and mobile development. `JavaScript` is usually used on the front end of an application to be executed within a browser. Still, there are implementations of back end JavaScript used to develop entire web applications, like [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

While `HTML` and `CSS` are mainly in charge of how a web page looks, `JavaScript` is usually used to control any functionality that the front end web page requires. Without `JavaScript`, a web page would be mostly static and would not have much functionality or interactive elements.
