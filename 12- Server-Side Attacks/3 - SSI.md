Server-Side Includes (SSI) is a technology web applications use to create dynamic content on HTML pages. SSI is supported by many popular web servers such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html) and [IIS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/serversideinclude).
Typical file extensions include `.shtml`, `.shtm`, and `.stm`. However, web servers can be configured to support SSI directives in arbitrary file extensions. As such, we cannot conclusively conclude whether SSI is used only from the file extension.

```ssi
<!--#exec cmd="whoami" -->
```
