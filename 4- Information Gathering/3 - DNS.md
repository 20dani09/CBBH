The Domain Name System (DNS) functions as the internet's GPS, translating user-friendly domain names into the numerical IP addresses computers use to communicate. Like GPS converting a destination's name into coordinates, DNS ensures your browser reaches the correct website by matching its name with its IP address. This eliminates memorizing complex numerical addresses, making web navigation seamless and efficient.

The `dig` command allows you to query DNS servers directly, retrieving specific information about domain names. For instance, if you want to find the IP address associated with `example.com`, you can execute the following command:

```bash
dig example.com A
```

This command instructs `dig` to query the DNS for the `A` record (which maps a hostname to an IPv4 address) of `example.com`. The output will typically include the requested IP address, along with additional details about the query and response. By mastering the `dig` command and understanding the various DNS record types, you gain the ability to extract valuable information about a target's infrastructure and online presence.

DNS servers store various types of records, each serving a specific purpose:

|Record Type|Description|
|---|---|
|A|Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.|
|AAAA|Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.|
|CNAME|Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.|
|MX|Specifies mail servers responsible for handling email for the domain.|
|NS|Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.|
|TXT|Stores arbitrary text information.|
|SOA|Contains administrative information about a DNS zone.|
