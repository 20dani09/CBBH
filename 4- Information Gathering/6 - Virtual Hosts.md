Virtual hosting is a technique that allows multiple websites to share a single IP address. Each website is associated with a unique hostname, which is used to direct incoming requests to the correct site. This can be a cost-effective way for organizations to host multiple websites on a single server, but it can also create a challenge for web reconnaissance.

Since multiple websites share the same IP address, simply scanning the IP won't reveal all the hosted sites. You need a tool that can test different hostnames against the IP address to see which ones respond.

Gobuster is a versatile tool that can be used for various types of brute-forcing, including virtual host discovery. Its `vhost` mode is designed to enumerate virtual hosts by sending requests to the target IP address with different hostnames. If a virtual host is configured for a specific hostname, Gobuster will receive a response from the web server.

To use Gobuster to brute-force virtual hosts, you'll need a wordlist containing potential hostnames. Here's an example command:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://192.0.2.1 -w hostnames.txt
```

In this example, `-u` specifies the target IP address, and `-w` specifies the wordlist file. Gobuster will then systematically try each hostname in the wordlist and report any that results in a valid response from the web server.

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:52938/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```
