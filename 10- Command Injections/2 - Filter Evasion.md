A space is a commonly blacklisted character, using `tabs (%09) `instead of spaces

Using the (`$IFS`) Linux Environment Variable may also work since its default value is a space and a tab, which would work between command arguments

`Bash Brace Expansion` feature, which automatically adds spaces between arguments wrapped between braces

```bash
{ls,-la}
```
